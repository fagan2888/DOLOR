# DOLOR
A data reduction pipeline for the [DOLORES](http://www.tng.iac.es/instruments/lrs/) spectrograph mounted on the [Telescopio Nazionale Galileo](http://www.tng.iac.es/).
It is designed to work both for multi-object spectrograph (MOS) and long-slit (LS) mode.

The pipeline will perform standard tasks for spectroscopic reduction: 
- noise subtraction (bias)
- response normalization (flat field)
- distortion correction
- spectrum extraction
- skyline subtraction
- wavelength calibration
