# DOLOR
A data reduction pipeline for the DOLORES spectrograph mounted on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG).
It is designed to work both for multi-object spectrograph (MOS) and long-slit (LS) mode.

The pipeline performs standard tasks for spectroscopic reduction: 
- noise subtraction (bias)
- response normalization (flat field)
- spectrum extraction
- skyline subtraction
- wavelength calibration
